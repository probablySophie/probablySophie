## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm about:  
â˜… Lightweight, sustainable, and open-source tech  
â˜… Permaculture & environmentalism

Trying to be one node in the distributed web of people creating an accessible, free, and friendly internet.  
For humans.  By humans.

We can only try and be better today than we were yesterday.
